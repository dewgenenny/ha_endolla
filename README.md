# Home Assistant Endolla Integration
Home Assistant integration to fetch Endolla charging station information in Barcelona

Usage is straight forward - add a new integration, then it will request the stationID (you need to find this yourself - I used chargefinder.com to figure it out)

Then the integration will fetch an update every 5 minutes.
